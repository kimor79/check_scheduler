This is a perl-based forking remote monitoring scheduler.

It is based on nagios concepts but is more piecemeal. This component is
just the process that runs the actual checks (nagios style scripts) without
the overhead of running the entire monitoring system. Because of this, some
functionality might be missing, like the ability to reschedule a check for
"now".

check_scheduler can do about 8 checks/second with a total of ~7000 checks on
a single server.
